# 🎓 UniApply – The Common Admission App for Bangladesh

## 💡 Why UniApply?

Bangladesh’s current university admission system is fragmented and overwhelming—students often have to apply separately to 10+ universities. **UniApply** acts as a digital bridge that reduces duplication and levels the playing field by streamlining this process on a modern, mobile-first interface.
